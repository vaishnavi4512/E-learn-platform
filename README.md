E-Learn is a modern, responsive front-end website created to represent a virtual education platform. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and (optionally) JavaScript, and is designed to provide users with a smooth, engaging interface for exploring courses and accessing video-based content.

The website includes all the essential elements of a professional learning platform: a fixed header with navigation, a call-to-action (CTA) banner, and a user-friendly layout. It provides the foundation for a full-featured Learning Management System (LMS) and can be extended with dynamic content, course management features, and authentication mechanisms.

As a Computer Science student passionate about building impactful educational tools, I developed this E-Learn project during my web development internship. The site showcases my ability to create structured and visually consistent web pages, while also aligning with real-world usability standards and UI/UX principles.
